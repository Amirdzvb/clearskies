Rsync Extension
---------------

This is an optional protocol extension.  The official extension string is
"rsync".  Extension negotiation is covered in the core protocol documentation.

The rsync extension increases wire efficiency by only transferring the parts of
files that have changed.

The behavior of the algorithm works similar to the "rdiff" command available
for unix, where the "signature", "delta", and "patch" steps are done separately.

For file transfer, if a local file is already present and a delta is desired,
instead of issuing a "get" request, a "rsync.signature" request with a binary
payload can be sent:

```json
{
  "type": "rsync.signature",
  "path": "photos/img1.jpg"
}
```

The peer then responds with an "rsync.patch" message, with a binary payload of
the actual patch generated by the "delta" command:

```json
{
  "type": "rsync.patch",
  "path": "photos/img1.jpg"
}
```

The software then uses the patch and the old file to create a temporary file,
which is then used to overwrite the old file after verification of the SHA256
sum, as normal.
