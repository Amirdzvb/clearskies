ClearSkies
==========

ClearSkies is a sync program similar to DropBox, except it does not require a
monthly fee.  Instead, you set up shares between two or more computers and the
sharing happens amongst them directly.

Its name derives from the idea that a day without the cloud will have a "clear
sky".

ClearSkies is inspired by BitTorrent Sync, but is has an open protocol, that
can be audited for security strength.

This repository contains the protocol documentation as well as an in-the-works
reference implementation.
