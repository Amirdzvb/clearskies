Proof of Concept License Switch
===============================

It has [been proposed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clearskies-dev/sTlXzBO4IUY/yoeQHGDwbjEJ)
to switch the license of the ruby clearskies implementation from GPLv3 to
LGPLv3.

Only a few authors contributed code to the proof-of-concept ruby application in
this repository.  This document is meant to track acceptance or rejection of
the proposal.

If not all contributors accept, the license will remain GPLv3 for the ruby app,
or the lines in question will be removed or rewritten.

This file is temporary and will only be kept in the git commit log as proof.

Note: Contributions to `protocol/` have been excluded, as it is under its own
license.
